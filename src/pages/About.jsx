            A software engineer by way of performance art, I started learning by
            teaching myself C# and Unity during lockdown.

            Hi, I'm Emily. I'm a Full-Stack developer with an emphasis on the
            Front-End, a former middle school teacher, and an indie video game
            developer. Before I wrote code, I made art -- programming for live
            interactive performances and making games.
            <br></br>
            <hr></hr>I started considering moving more into the tech world after
            finishing my MFA thesis project, lookingGlass, a Unity3d game, in
            2020. I had been working for nine months on a live performance, but
            in March COVID-19 hit, and, the world changed. I didn't want to do a
            staged reading or something pre-recorded that would stream on Zoom,
            so I decided to translate the show using the vocabulary of video
            games. I learned C# and how to use Unity. Three months later, the
            game was live, and, as I say, I had discovered a new passion. 
            <br></br>

            From May-December of 2023, I worked with the Frontend team at meQuilibrium as an
            intern, taking Jira tickets and learning best practices for working
            as part of a team according to the Agile methodology, how to address
            accessibility concerns, and how to write concise, effective code for
            React.
            <br></br>
            <hr></hr>
            Subsequently, I have been working as a freelancer. I'm happy to
            be working with two companies, one as a full-stack developer in
            EdTech, the other as a frontend dev in Enterprise Resource Planning.
            I am currently focusing for one on automated test development with
            Cypress, and for the other on building out a frontend using
            TypeScript and Tailwind. While I am extremely grateful to have these
            projects in my life, I still feel I have more to offer. I would love to find a group to
            work with in this new year where I could work full-time as part of a
            team, growing and building together.
