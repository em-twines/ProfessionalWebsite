                  I'm Emily, and I write code.

                  Well mostly I read code. And I read about code. But mostly people think I write code, so that's often the easiest to say.

                  Before I wrote code, I made art -- programming for live interactive performances and making games. I sort of think coding is art too. I love a good puzzle and a detailed error message, and am always excited to see a project through the finish line. I'm enthusiastic and inquisitive, and just generally really enjoy doing what I do. Thanks for checking out my work, and feel free to reach out!
