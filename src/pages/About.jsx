                  I'm Emily Delbridge, and I'm a software developer with experience programming for live interactive performances, web apps, and gaming. I'm comfortable working in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Java, C#, and Python, with Django, Spring, and Sql, and, on occasion, with MaxMSP. I work in service of creation, remembering the past, but thinking always to the future.
