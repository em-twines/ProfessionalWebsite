            A software engineer by way of performance art, I started learning by
            teaching myself C# and Unity during lockdown.

            Three months later, lookingGlass was live, and I had discovered a
            new passion.

            Hi, I'm Emily. I'm a Full-Stack developer with an emphasis on the Front-End, a former middle school teacher, and an indie video game developer. Before I wrote code, I made art -- programming for live interactive performances and making games. I sort of think coding is art too.
            <br></br>
            <hr></hr>I started considering moving more into the tech world after finishing my MFA thesis project, lookingGlass, a Unity3d video game, in May of 2020. I had been working for nine months on a live performance, but in March,
            the world changed. I didn't want to do a staged reading or something pre-recorded that would stream on Zoom, so I decided to translate
            the show using the vocabulary of video games. I learned how to code in C# and how to use Unity, how to manage a server and how to host web content. By the day of the performance, lookingGlass was live, and a new door for me was opened.
            <br></br>
            <hr></hr>
            Since May, I have been working on the Frontend team at meQuilibrium as an intern, taking Jira tickets and learning best practices for working as part of a team according to the Agile methodology, how to address accessibility concerns, convert pages from Angular, and how to write concise, effective code for React.
