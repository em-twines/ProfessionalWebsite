            A software engineer by way of performance art, I started learning by
            teaching myself C# and Unity during lockdown.

            Three months later, lookingGlass was live, and I had discovered a
            new passion.

            Hi, I'm Emily. I'm a Full-Stack developer, a former middle school
            teacher, and an indie video game designer. Before I wrote code, I
            made art -- programming for live interactive performances and making
            games. I sort of think coding is art too. I love a good puzzle and a
            detailed error message, and am always excited to see a project
            through the finish line. I'm enthusiastic and inquisitive, and just
            generally enjoy doing what I do.
            <br></br>
            <hr></hr>I started considering moving more into the tech world after
            finishing my MFA thesis project, lookingGlass, in May of 2020. I had
            been working for nine months on a live performance, but in March,
            the world changed. I didn't want to do a staged reading or something
            pre-recorded that would stream on Zoom, so I decided to translate
            the show using the vocabulary of video games. I learned how to code
            in C# and how to use Unity, how to manage a server and how to host
            web content. By the day of the performance, lookingGlass was live,
            and a new door for me was opened.
            <hr></hr>
            <br></br>In October I took the next step and enrolled in an
            intensive Full-Stack boot-camp. As a graduate, I am now looking
            for opportunities that will help me grow as a developer. I love
            working in React and everything about sending data around the
            frontend and crafting the UI, but I also really enjoy sculpting the
            data from the start in Django or Spring. I'm excited for what's next, and can't wait
            to learn more!
            <br></br>
